# C & C's Oyster Bar 
## Live Page > [C & C's Oyster Bar](https://charliebarger.github.io/Resturaunt-Website/)
This is a Fictional Resturaunt Page that I made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTMl, & CSS. The content of the pages is not hard coded in the HTML. Instead the content are appended with Javascript. The site is based on the aesthetic of seafood resturaunts along the Forgotton Coast in the panhandle of Florida, and my girlfriend
and I's long off dream of owning one someday.
